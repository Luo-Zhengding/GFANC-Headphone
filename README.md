This is a collaborative research work between the Digital Signal Processing Lab at Nanyang Technological University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, and National University of Singapore.

## Research Background
The **deep learning-based Generative Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control (GFANC)** method can generate suitable control filters for different noise types, achieving faster response and better noise reduction than conventional approaches. However, its transferability and practical performance have not yet been fully validated. In this paper, the deep learning-based GFANC method is implemented in an Active Noise Control (ANC) headphone. A theoretical explanation of GFANCâ€™s transferability is also provided.
